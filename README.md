# Travel Planner App Project

## Instructions
To get the API functions working, three API values must be populated in a file named '.env' located in the root directory. This file should include the following three lines:
DarkSkyKey=<VALUE>
geonamesID=<VALUE>
PixabayKey=<VALUE>

Where <VALUE> is replaced by the ID or key given for each of those API services.

To run the app in development mode, enter the commands "npm run start" and "npm run build-dev" from the fend directory inside a termal. To compile the app to deploy to production, run the command "npm run build" instead. This will place the compiled app in the dist/ folder.
