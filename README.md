# Travel Planner App Project

## Instructions
To run the app in development mode, enter the commands "npm run start" and "npm run build-dev" from the fend directory inside a termal. To compile the app to deploy to production, run the command "npm run build" instead. This will place the compiled app in the dist/ folder.
